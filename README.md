## Devlog
In my code's Penguin class, it destroys a coin if the penguin collides with it, adds a point to a variable, and sends the value of the variable to the GameController class to update the point text. This connects to my break-down activity as those are the interactions I predicted the Penguin would have with the other classes/objects.
